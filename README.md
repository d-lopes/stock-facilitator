Stock Facilitator
======
Wouldn't it be nice if we had an application that generates a couple of reasonable proposals for currently attractive stocks?
We could simply gather some data regarding a list of stocks and define some rules based on all that information.

This sums up the idea for this project - pretty much. :)

The **Stock Facilitator** is a web application for the generation and management of ideas for an investment in stocks. 

For a start there are two core requirements:

- REQ-1: When I look for shares to invest in, the web application has to propose the top 10 shares based on the current stock prices and further statistical data.
- REQ-2: When I select one of the proposed shares, the web application has to give me an overview of all relevant information. 

What information exactly will be available still needs to be specified further.

#### Screenshot
The web application is still in pre-release phase. Thus there are no screenshos yet.
